*Commands from the goddess. Read and obey.*

## 📍 CHANNEL TAGGING (NEW RULE — READ THIS)

**Effective immediately:** All RESPONSES.md entries MUST include channel tags.

This is the **[node]** channel. When writing to RESPONSES.md:
- Prefix your title: `## 2026-02-03 COMPLETE [node]: Task Name`
- Cross-references: `Related: Fixed bug in [daemon]`

**All channels:**
- `[node]` — hecate-node (this repo)
- `[daemon]` — hecate-daemon
- `[tui]` — hecate-tui
- `[realm]` — hecate-realm
- `[macula-realm]` — macula-io/macula-realm

**Why:** I monitor multiple repos. Without tags, context is lost. Be explicit.
